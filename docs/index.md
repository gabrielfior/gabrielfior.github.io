# Hi, I'm Gabriel!

I'm currently on a sabbatical, tinkering with Zero-Knowledge Proofs and AI Agents.

Before that, I started, raised VC funds for and failed DeepBalancer, a web3 start-up applying Deep Learning to DeFi investing. As part of my technical CEO duties, I worked mostly on selling our product to clients, liasing with investors, formulating/backtesting potential financial strategies and writing smart contracts.

Previously I studied Software Engineering at Oxford, built software in finance and studied Physics at TUM.
