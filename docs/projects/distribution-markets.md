# Distribution Markets: Why Prediction Markets Should Think in Curves, Not Buckets

> **tl;dr:** We propose a new prediction market primitive where traders submit full probability distributions over continuous outcomes (e.g., "ETH will be $3,200 ± $200"), rather than buying discrete Yes/No shares in fixed buckets. This eliminates liquidity fragmentation, captures trader confidence, and produces a richer, more composable information signal.

## The Problem: Discrete Markets Waste Information

If you've used Polymarket, you've seen markets like this:

**"Solana price on April 23?"**
- 11 discrete buckets: `<$40`, `$40-50`, `$50-60`, ..., `$120-130`, `>$130`
- **$11,234 in volume split across 11 separate liquidity pools**
- Only one bucket resolves YES

This design is simple, but it discards almost everything interesting about what traders actually believe.

| What discrete markets destroy | What we lose |
|---|---|
| **Precision** | A trader who thinks ETH = $3,247.63 must round to the nearest bucket |
| **Confidence** | Someone "80% sure" and someone "51% sure" make the exact same trade |
| **Liquidity** | Each bucket is its own tiny AMM; spreads are wide everywhere |
| **Composability** | You cannot derive "P(ETH > $3,500)" without summing bucket prices manually |

In short: **discrete buckets force traders to approximate their beliefs, fragment liquidity, and throw away the rich information contained in a full distribution.**

## The Idea: Trade Distributions, Not Binary Shares

In a **Distribution Market**, traders don't buy Yes/No shares. They submit a full **probability distribution** over a continuous outcome — for example, a Normal distribution `N(μ, σ)` predicting the price of ETH on May 1.

- **μ (mean):** Where they think the price will land
- **σ (standard deviation):** How confident they are (narrow = confident, wide = uncertain)

The market maintains a **capital-weighted consensus distribution** — a mixture of every trader's view, weighted by how much capital they put behind it.

At resolution, if ETH lands at `x*`, your payout depends on one simple ratio:

```
payout = your_collateral × your_density(x*) / market_density(x*)
```

If you assigned more probability to the realized outcome than the market consensus did, you earn more than your collateral. If you assigned less, you earn less. This is a **proper scoring rule**: it is mathematically optimal for you to report your true beliefs.

**Most importantly, the sum of all payouts always equals the total collateral.** This is not an approximation — it is an exact algebraic identity. The contract can never become insolvent.

## Three Immediate Advantages

### 1. Infinite Granularity
There are no bucket boundaries. A trader submits μ = 3247.63, and the market price at *every* real number is simultaneously discoverable.

### 2. Confidence Is Tradeable
σ is not a side effect — it's a **first-class tradeable parameter**. A trader who is highly confident submits a narrow σ and pays more for that precision. A trader who is uncertain submits a wide σ and pays less. The market **explicitly prices uncertainty**.

### 3. No Liquidity Fragmentation
All trading concentrates in a single pool. With the same total volume as a discrete market, a Distribution Market has deeper liquidity at every price point, tighter spreads, and better price discovery.

## The Multimodal Mixture (And Why It's a Feature)

A natural question: if traders disagree — say, bears cluster at $2,900 and bulls at $3,800 — the consensus distribution becomes **multimodal** with a low-density "gap" between them.

If ETH resolves in that gap, everyone gets near-zero payout. This looks like a bug, but it's not. **Genuine disagreement is real information.** The market should display the consensus honestly — two peaks, a flag for "low-confidence zone between $X and $Y" — rather than forcing a false unimodal consensus.

We are also exploring a **hybrid scoring fallback**: when the market density falls below a threshold in gap zones, transition to a distance-based scoring against a reference Normal. This prevents the "total loss in the gap" failure mode without breaking the proper scoring rule under normal conditions.

## Scaling: Merkle Proofs for Gas Efficiency

The resolution step requires computing each trader's probability density at the realized outcome — an O(N) loop. This is a **one-time cost paid by the resolver**; trade gas stays cheap.

For very large markets, we can move computation off-chain and verify it on-chain with a **Merkle proof**: the resolver submits a Merkle root of all `(trader, density)` pairs, and each trader claims by providing a Merkle path proving their individual value. Resolution gas becomes constant regardless of participant count.

## Where This Fits

Our work is heavily inspired by Paradigm's [*Distribution Markets*](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/12/distribution-markets) paper (December 2024). We adopt their core insights — function-space markets, L2 norm cost functions, and proper scoring rules — but make two practical simplifications for an on-chain MVP:

| Paradigm's Vision | Our MVP |
|---|---|
| Non-parametric functions (any PDF) | Parametric Normal distributions (O(1) storage) |
| Continuous function-space AMM | Capital-weighted average at resolution + Merkle proofs |
| Full L2 ball invariant | L2 norm used for fee scaling + minimum collateral |

We view this as a **practical first step** toward the full vision to move closer to non-parametric, continuous-function markets.

## What's Next

We are currently building in three parallel tracks:

1. **Agent-based simulations** — to validate the scoring rule, stress-test fee calibration, and generate concrete worked examples
2. **Solidity implementation** — Foundry + PRB-Math, with both O(N) resolution and Merkle-proof variants
3. **Testnet deployment** — Gnosis Chiado pilot with a single ETH spot-price market

If you're a prediction market researcher, mechanism designer, or smart contract engineer, we'd love your feedback.
